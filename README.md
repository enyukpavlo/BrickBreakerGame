# Brick Breaker Game

Imitation of the classic brick-destroying "Breakout" game.

The start is very simple, as I have taken the basic Kivy Pong application, stripped down elements that do not apply to a breakout game (like a second player, field divisions, multiple score readouts) and changed the math to make the game vertically focused instead of horizontally.
